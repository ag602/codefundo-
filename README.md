The main issue which arises in almost every natural disaster is the-"lack of communication".
IDEA(First Part):
So, the idea behind our model is to reduce the communication gap between the sufferers and the helpers.
For that, the phones should be integrated with transmitter which will send immediate signal in the form of a 'message' when the person is in trouble, to the reciever.
Phones must have a capacity to be integrated with satellite so as to provide effective communication during the calamity.
IDEA(Second Part):
As soon as the message is received by the software(which we would build), we will have a DBMS, in which we will keep track of the person's details.
Details include: Current location, name of people, number of people visible to him/her, food and medical requirement, etc
The details will be managed by Azure's SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) which will be updated 'real-time' by the software using 'Microsoft Integration Services'.
